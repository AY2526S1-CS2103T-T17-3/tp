# Organ-izer User Guide

**Organi-zer** is a desktop application that **manages a database of organ donor recipients**.
It is intended for **organ donation coordinators** who require an **easy, fast, and efficient** way to
**navigate a database** and find the **right recipient**, during the **short time window** that an organ is available for donation.

If you are an **organ donation coordinator** at a healthcare facility, **Organ-izer** allows you to:

* **Easily** view your list of potential organ recipients, complete with emergency contact details, blood type, and priority.

* **Efficiently** navigate a database of potential organ recipients.

    * **Organ-izer** uses a **Command Line Interface** (CLI), which means that all functions of the application are accessible via typed commands.

    * If you can type fast, **Organ-izer** can coordinate organ donation much faster than traditional mouse-based applications.

**Organ-izer** is based on the existing [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html) project, and is optimized for the time-critical environment under which organ donation occurs in a hospital.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>
<markdown>
**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent user inputs.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a user input, representing a recipient's **name**,<br>
  which the user can provide by entering `add n/John Doe`.

* Words in square brackets represent optional inputs.<br>
  To exclude an optional input, do not type the prefix of that input
  e.g. in `n/NAME [t/TAG]` the user may enter `n/John Doe t/friend`,<br>
  or enter `n/John Doe`, if they don't wish to provide a **tag** input. The same applies for emergency contact fields.

* Words followed by `…`​ after them, can be provided **multiple times**,<br>
  including **zero times**, if the user does not wish to provide an input.<br>
  e.g. in `[t/TAG]…​` the user can :<br>
  enter `  `, if the user does not wish to provide a tag,<br>
  or enter `t/friend`, to provide 1 tag,<br>
  or enter `t/friend t/family`, to provide 2 tags etc.

* Inputs can be supplied in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, users can either, <br>
  enter `n/John p/92316570` **or** `p/92316570 n/John`.

* For commands that **don't need any user inputs** (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`),<br>
  any user inputs after the command will be **ignored.**<br>
  e.g. if the user entered `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="note" seamless>
<markdown>
**Note:** 
* This restoration only applies to the `search` command, and does not apply to other commands that narrow down the recipients such as `compatible` or `bloodtype`.
* Calling `list` after `search KEYWORD` will restore the list of displayed recipients back to showing all entries, so closing and reopening the app will not restore the search result.
</markdown>
</box>

### Saving the data

Organ-izer data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

**Organ-izer** data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/organ-izer.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
<markdown>
**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Organ-izer will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Organ-izer to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</markdown>
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Organ-izer home folder.

**Q**: Why are phone numbers with more or less than 8 digits not allowed?
**A**: The application is based in Singapore, where phone number formats are only 8 digits. Although other countries may have 8 digit phone numbers as well, such as Thailand, the app is still only used by individuals who are currently in Singapore. The 8 digit rule is to prevent mishaps by users such as double pressing a digit or skipping past a digit accidentally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
